# Timeline

1. Want to study Japanese
2. Thought of CLI tool, but know Anki exists
3. Anki has outdated interface with non-customizable keybinds, and I prefer terminal workflow
4. Find spaced repetition algorithm Anki uses -> https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/The-Algorithm
5. Asked cousin Tommy to learn what the symbols in the equations mean. Learned about partial derivatives
âˆ‚ = partial derative
6. Used `sesh` from Josh Medeski to identify a good CLI lib in Go
